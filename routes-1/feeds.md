    "created_at":"2016-12-09T11:32:52.011Z",

    "location": {

        "lng": 106.869342
    }
}' "https://data.petabencana.id/feeds/qlue"
```

Report was successfully created:

```javascript

  "post_id": 1234567802,
  "created": true

```

The request was successful however the report already exists:

```javascript

  "message": "1234567802 already exists in reports table"
}
```
