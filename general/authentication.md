# Authentication

The Petabencana API exposes some protected routes which will require authentication to access few API endpoints (see [Authenticated API](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-MPDZ\_lSLJEcu9sJTiy--887967055/\~/changes/FHZxzleBDEXMkDTZ4YeM/routes-1)). Authentication is via a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/introduction/)

Note: For a new API key, please reach out to PetaBencana team
