# Crowdsourced Reports/Timeseries

Time series of flood reports \(see [Reports endpoint](crowdsourced-reports.md) documentation\), presented as the count of flood reports every hour within the specified time period. Count is recorded alongside an hourly timestamp in ISO8601 format at UTC+0.

| end | End time for timeseries period | String in ISO 8601 format \(YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss+ZZZZ | Yes |
